# UsacoTrainingGift1
This is a java solution to the  USACO training problem Gift1.
This isn't very efficient, I am not efficient at programming.

It took me some time to figure out how to use the BufferedReader and PrintWriter, and the purpose of uploading my solution is to show how the BufferedReader and PrintWriter can work in solving these types of problems.
